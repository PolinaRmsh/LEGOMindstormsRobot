# Lego Robot

The robot consists of two parts: the moving one and the lifting one.

## Moving part

The moving part was assembled by Polina Rymshina and Jharna Chhutari. 
The robot uses two big motors to move. In the Lego Mindstorms IDE the moving direction can be set by giving different power to the motors.

## Lifting part

The lifting part was assembled by Thao Pham and Djamali Dollison. 
The robot uses a medium motor to move the lifting arms and close/open the grabbing claw.

## Background

The project was created for the Fundamentals for ICT Students Course at Fontys University of Applied Sciences, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. It was created by a team of 4 people (you can see the member list [further](#authors) in the document).
